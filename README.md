# MXNet in Perl

This collection of scripts replicates [Thom Lane](https://medium.com/apache-mxnet/mxnet-gluon-in-60-minutes-3d49eccaf266)'s [_MXNet Crash Course_](https://beta.mxnet.io/guide/crash-course/index.html) in Perl using the [AI::MXNet](https://metacpan.org/pod/AI::MXNet) module by [Sergey Kolychev](http://blogs.perl.org/users/sergey_kolychev/).

When writing the Perl module, Kolychev kept the Perl syntax as similar as possible to the Python syntax, so that the Python documentation would also document the Perl module.  In that spirit, these scripts replicate the _MXNet Crash Course_ as closely as possible.

Lane's work is worth replicating because it's an excellent introduction. And it's also worth replicating because replication highlights the similarities between the Perl and Python interfaces and draws attention to important differences.

For discussion of these scripts and this replication, please visit [Napizia](https://www.napizia.com/pages/mxnet/index.shtml).  We look forward to seeing you there!
